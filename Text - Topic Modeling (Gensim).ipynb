       "[\"I had a devil of a time downloading the drivers for this printer, but that is probably a problem with my computer rather than the printer.  Otherwise, set-up is easy.  For those who need it, there IS a quite good on-line manual for this printer, but the set-up instructions that come with the box don't tell you that.  I can't even find in the instructions an answer to this question, though:  Can you set it up for BOTH wired contact with a desktop PC AND a wireless laptop at the same time?  Seems like a simple and common question to ask, and it's puzzling that Canon hasn't anticipated it.I am very happy with the printer's operation....it does 1- to 2-sided printing and copying quite easily.  There something quite confusing about the screen options on the front though.  There is simply no menu option for printing.  There are options for fax, copying and one or two other things, but I still haven't figured out how to switch FROM copying to normal printing; sometimes the PC just overrides the printer's setting, but sometimes it doesn't.BTW, I just bought this to replace a Canon 722 that I bought a few months ago.  The 722's printer trays broke within a couple of days (some kind of clip fell off, and I continued to use the trays without them, but could never figure out how to replace.  The printer trays on the 722 are flimsy.  Those on the 922 seem a bit better, but only time will tell.This is a great printer for the price.\",\n",
       " 'OK, I have waited a while to post this review to see how well this printer fits my needs.  First, let me say that my previous Canon Pixma model stopped suddenly after over 4 good years of use, so I really have nothing to complain about there- I got it for about $30 so go my moneys worth.  It went out without warning (and after I had just purchased refill cartridges, of course!) so I was in panic mode to replace it (gotta be able to print my coupons!), which is always a bad scenario. I looked at every lower priced option I could find that ALSO had reasonably priced refills and the week I made my purchase, this was the only printer I found that met those criteria. Of course two days AFTER I received this one, Best Buy had two  printers that I could have purchased with a few less features and $25 less! So, in reference to the features, let me say this:  If you are looking for a \"throw away\"  printer for just basic printing needs like myself (receipts, coupons, recipes, etc.) then you might want to wait for one of those less expensive versions with fewer features.  This one has so many things that I will never use- I have not even hooked up the Wi-Fi yet-just have it connected via the USB cable that came with my other Canon printer (glad it fit).  I will probably try it sometime to use with my Asus Trasformer, but for now I just use that USB cord for both (my Asus has a full sized USB port.)One thing I don\\'t like is the paper tray being so close to the bottom of the printer- I had to put four furniture guards under each corner to lift the unit up high enough to get the tray open and closed without catching on the mats I use to protect the wooden file cabinet it sits on.  I would rather have the paper feed on the top back part of the printer like my previous Canon-makes it easier to turn the paper around and print on the bottom or other side of the paper (when you print coupons frequently, you will be doing this a lot.)  Just personal preference.It also seems to have a mind of it\\'s own as far as how soon printing will start- sometimes it starts quickly, other times I can read my e mails waiting for it to start.  I\\'m sure it\\'s not unusual in multi functional printers, just irritating.I am still on the ink cartridges that came with the printer, but I did purchase the refills from Blake Printing that were referred by several others. They were very reasonable (10 pk for $19.99)-hopefully they will work fine when the time comes to switch them out. The print quality had been very good- have not printed any photos yet, but I am actually eager to try out this option.  Also, the scanner works well too, but I don\\'t use all the scanning features it has-just scan to file, then use it from there.All in all, I am sure this is a very good (albeit very heavy) printer for someone who is more tech savvy than I am and who needs all the features it has to offer.  I am only using a small percentage of what it can do- I would actually have preferred another simple Canon like my previous model, but, of course, it has been discontinued. Still, it prints great and the price was right (Amazon lightening deal) so as long as it lasts another 4 years, I\\'m good!',\n",
       " \"I love this printer.It prints quickly, scans images and documents perfectly, and took me no time at all to set up for either my PC's direct connection, over a hardwired network, or over Wifi.I really appreciate its ability to print double sided while not smudging either side.The up side:Prints double sided in either orientation you choose (top-top or top-bottom)Scans double sided (this is the default setting)Prints incredible photosScans any document or photo with near perfect quality for documentsVery easy and quick replacement of ink cartridges or paperEasy to clean or get to any jam (I haven't had it jam even once)The down side:When scanning multiple pages, it sometimes will grab a few of them at once or pull the second down while the first is scanning, causing it to alert you of a paper jam. It doesn't actually jam or get stuck, it just thinks it did.My only issue was it randomly needing to be reset to accept a USB device that was over 16GB sometimes, but that didn't happen except for twice in the time I've had the printer.The photo printing quality is fantastic, and really does live up to its name and original price. Canon printers are definitely the way to go.If you can get this on a sale, you'll be incredibly lucky and pleased with your purchase. If not, you'll still be very pleased, just not as lucky. :P\",\n",
       " 'I did not anticipate it being this big but nonetheless it was easy to set up the only thing i continuously have issues with is the paper, when it runs low or is out the printer sends a message to realign the paper this has to be played around with numerous times until the printer starts functioning again not sure why this is. When it is working properly its great and its bluetooth making it convenient for when i want to print straight from my phone. My daughter also uses it to print things off of her mac book. Im excited to use it for pictures !',\n",
       " 'I ordered the Canon Office and Business MX922 All in One printer for my home. I was amazed and how easy it was to install this printer. I did run into a bit of trouble, as I did not know why my the printer would not recognize my WiFi tower address, so I called the Canon support number that was included in the packing materials, and got a great Canon, Customer service rep, who walked me though the rest of the set up. After we got the printer to recognize my WiFi, the printer now works great! It looks exactly as described in the description. I have this printer located in another room which is about 75 to 80 feet, and it prints perfectly. Great find for the price!!!',\n",
       " \"I have ordered the Epson Workforce WF3640 and it seems like it took forever to ship.  Once it shipped, it arrived in a few days.  Unfortuantely, it was broke right out of the box.  It was my first Epson and I guess my last. I will still stick with Canon.  This Pixma MX922 was replacing my old MX320 that was still working like a charm but I needed WiFi so here I am now with my Canon Pixma MX922.First of of it had the same ship period the Epson did but the big difference was it only took them one day to get it ready for shipping and just a couple of days before it arrived.  So, I am already happy.  However, the proof is in the pudding.  I unpacked my new MX922 and pressed the start button.  Unlike the Epson, this baby, went through the initial setup.  I followed the instructions and it completed the setup.The next step was the WiFi.  Very easy setup.  All I had to do was press the WPS on my router and click ok on the printer and it found my network.  Next step was to connect printer to my laptop via WiFi.  I installed the setup program from the included DVD and bingo, my laptop was now printing a test sheet with no issues.  The next step was to bring my wife's laptop in and run the DVD setup on it.  Once again, no issues.  Wow!Last night, my wife decides to print for the 1st time using the MX922 from the living room. I am thinking, please let it work.  Well, there was no need for worry. It did what it was suppose to do.  I like it.It was easy to setup from start to finish and more importantly it worked without any issues.  Way to go Canon!\",\n",
       " \"I had benn using HP printers since there was inkjet. Usually, HP printers won't die. They were just obsoleted by new models. But, my last one had inkjet head error. So, I think it is time for me to explore other brand. I chose Canon MX922 because it comes with automatic scanner.After using it for 3 months, I conclude that HP printer users should think seriously before switching to Canon. Canon, like my other Japanese product, has much clunkier software. If you did not print for a couple of weeks, the first time it prints, it will do all sort of re-calibration which might take a few minutes. I never had this issue with HP which always prints right away.Similarly, the scanning software is slow and clumsy. If you use autoscan, it takes a while to figure out it is document or photo. So, you shouldn't do this. You should choose scan photo or scan document by yourself which requires you a few more clicks to reach that option.Then, there is color consistency issue. When I printed photo before, the color always came out predictably. This might be because my monitor was consistent to HP color scheme. Canon 922 photos are warmer than HP's.The document scanner works OK but often the paper jams. If you want to scan both sides of the paper, it can if you go deep in the setting to find the check box. If one page jams, you end up spend more time than do it manually yourself. I recently bought an HP laser all-in-one at work. The HP document feeder works better.All in all, I regret to try Canon. It has quality for scanning and printing. But, it is just too slow. As I said, the hardware might be fine. The software shares the similarity in many Japanese software which asks repeated obvious questions.If you are used to HP's snappiness, Canon software is not for you.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this printer to print from our IOS devices via airprint.  Turns out there is no way to specify the 8.5x11 second tray as the default for all printing.  Try to print a photo from an ipad and the image format sent to the printer is interpreted as needing smaller photo paper in tray 1 even if you want it to print on regular 8.5x11 paper in tray 2.  There isn't a way to make tray 2 the default for everything sent from an IOS device so don't buy this if you want smooth, problem free printing from your iphone/ipad.There is a long thread on the canon support forum on this that dates back two years.  Canon people have replied but have not answered the question or provided a fix.  They refer people to their support line.  I have the latest firmware so there isn't an update that would fix this issue.There is a workaround where, if your app can send to iBooks as PDF then you do that, then print from iBooks.  A pdf will print on 8.5x11 from tray 2 but not all apps offer that ability.This was a disappointment as the first thing I tried to do was print a photo from my ipad on a regular piece of paper and ran into this issue.  Come on Canon, add a setup option to set tray 2 as the default for everything and solve this basic issue.\",\n",
       " \"Quick, clean, cheap in price but not on quality. My wife is an author (children's non-fiction with well over 200 books to her name, as well as working on several fiction projects). She prints A LOT so we needed something that could take over the last Canon we killed after years and years of abuse. We have used Epson and HP printers before but nothing lasted nearly as long or as well as our last Canon Pixma. Anyways we love the wireless printing, the speed of this thing, and the wireless scanning features. It prints fast with high quality and does very well with color. I will admit that it is loud (there is a quiet feature to it but we haven't played with it too much). You won't want to be printing this if someone is trying to nap in the same room, but it is definitely quiet enough that a person one or two rooms away won't even hear it.This is not going to replace a workplace printer that is utilized by 6 or more people on a regular basis but it can handle having a couple of hundred pages being printed out on it on a regular basis. Nor will it take the place of a professional color printer. From what I've seen so far I trust that it will last as long as our last Canon printer (about 6 years) with very high usage and the punishing abuse of an author. I would highly recommend this for you. And at the price it is a great value.\",\n",
       " \"Upon receiving, I had no problems hooking it up to my Acer notebook with Windows 7 Home Premium with a spare USB cable that I happened to have. If you don't have a printer USB cable, I recommend buying one for the initial set-up and installation.I just received it, so I really can't write much of a review but so far so good. Tried out some of the basic functions, copy, scan, online document print, off line document print, offline photos, online photos and it works fantastic!By letting Windows do the Driver/Software Updates and installations instead of the supplied disk, it probably fixed the bugs others have complained about. I read some of the lower scored reviews and had no problems with noise, speed, or initialization (warm-up time).UPDATE: 4/13/15 (2nd day of ownership)While having fun figuring out all the features and functions I suddenly noticed a slow-down while initializing (warm-up) before a print job, which other reviewer's have written about. To find-out what the 'paper abrasion' option was for I selected it, Don't or it will slow down your print jobs to a crawl !.THIS IS WHAT I DID TO REMEDY THE LAG IN TIME,* Go to 'Devices and Printers * Right click on your printer * Go to Printer Properties * Select 'MX920 series properties' * Select the 'Maintenance' Tab *  Select 'Custom Settings' * Click on 'Defaults' and Voila!*Also, I  made sure I had the most recent Drivers/Updates for my printer to which there are three on the top of the list that I downloaded. There are several other Optional one's too, but I have no use for them. After, testing the printer out with the new drivers It seemed to respond and print even faster! IMHO, selecting the 'Canon MX920 series Printer XPS'  driver is faster.Below is the link,http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mx_series/pixma_mx922#DriversAndSoftware* Also, you might like to try: Go to 'Devices and Printers * Right click on your printer * Scroll up  to Printer Properties * Select the Preferences Button * Select 'Default Button * Press Apply * and 'OK'I found that  the printer is now more responsive with the default factory settings.I'm very happy with my purchase and glad to get rid of an obsolete HP printer, YeeeHaaa!\",\n",
       " '1.  Very, very slow to \"warm up.\"2.  Cloud print rarely works, only works after a setup or power cycled.  The only way to get it to work is to re-set it up with Google cloud print or power cycle it.  This is not a matter of the whole printer being asleep or genuinely offline, it answers pings and can always print from laptops on local LAN with printer drivers.  Google Cloud Print never works with this, Google always says it is offline.  I have an Epson that this replaced, the Epson had a print head failure and dribbled ink all over everything I printed and was very expensive to repair, I bought this new printer instead or repairing.  What a regret.  While I can\\'t print a clean image to that printer, Google cloud print NEVER says that it is offline.  Why is this Canon always offline when it uses the exact same WIFI LAN and internet connection and are only feet from each other?  Cycling the power so that Google Cloud Print says it is online is not an acceptable solution, nor is resetting it up with Google Cloud Print.  I\\'ve setup the Epson once with Google Cloud Print.  Too bad the Epson\\'s print head failed.  Bad software implementation of Google Cloud Print Canon.3.  The scanning to \"searchable\" PDF software that comes with this Canon is abysmal.  It rarely gets any words right.  The Epson software I had installed actually works with this printer too.  Lucky me.  With the Epson supplied software working with this Canon printer and the exact same paper with text laid on the glass tray and not even moved at all scans to searchable PDF and might get only 1 of 30 words wrong.  Stark difference there Canon.

I tried it dozens of times and then decided to call Canon tech services.They led me down several paths and finally came up with a real doozie of a solution.They said my computer lacked drivers. It's less than 1 year old and works just fine for everything else. They told me for a mere $150 for a 1 year fix or $200 for unlimited fix they could install the needed drivers. If this was the case , why didn't it state that it won't work with windows 8 ? I bet you can guess what I told them. I've bought my last canon product, and hope all who read this will give it a lot of thought before they do too. I'm going to contact Amazon and tell them in person (on the phone) what I think they should do with this product. I'll be sending it back today.\",\n",
       " 'I wanted to by another PIXMA 870 to replace the one that broke after 4 years.  i bought that printer through Newegg for $119. Amazon really wanted its customers to buy this model for some reason, because it was only $99. The 870 was over $300 on Amazon! I couldn\\'t even find that model anywhere else.  I really needed a printer, so i decided to stick with Canon. Unfortunately, this printer sucks, and it would be too much of a hassle to return it.  One of the main issues is that it is incompatible with my old Mac v. 10.4.11. Canon stopped making drivers for it. i\\'m thinking that\\'s because they want people to use the newer software that came with it. The 870 worked with the Mac on my wireless network without a problem.  Also, this printer has a lot of hidden expenses. Expenses, i don\\'t think I should have to incur - like for \"Prime\" printing and larger ink tanks. The printer is loud when it prepares to print, and takes forever to scan even all text documents. This \\'image garden\" concept is garbage, and there is too much of a learning curb, just to do basic things like print a multiple paged document or print on an envelope. i would advise those in the market for a new printer, to skip this one. Even at $99, it wasn\\'t a bargain.',\n",
       " 'This is my 2nd Canon printer. The first was very easy to set up. I consider my computer skills to be moderate to advance. After some frustrating time I finally got the WIFI connected. A week later, the printer said it was \"Off line\" even though the Wifi on the printer screen said it was connected.I gave up and contacted the Canon 800 support#. I give them 5 stars for there support. It turns our there is a driver update that you must download. After which the printer worked. I have 3 mac Book pro computers from 2012 - 2015. The older macs seem to work just fine. The newer ones did have a problem with the scanner software having to connect to macs scanner software, I was on the phone for over an hour with canon who couldnt be more patient and helpful. Little did i know that ***** Canon support is lifetime***** unlike HP which expires after a year.There are some issues with dual routers which was pointed out to me. The printer has to be connected to the lower older signal. The speed is faster than my older Canon. The delay to print is typical of a wireless printer.Now Google Print. That was easy to hook up however! Since this is a Beta Google product it goes down a lot. This is not Canons fault but Googles. Since it is Cloud base and google controls. My daughter has a google chrome laptop and after it being down for 2 days she must have tried to print her homework and the printer que held in the cloud started spitting out everything she wanted to print after it came back on line. This is very frustrating.The only negative so far is the set up needs to be done with the help of Canon, the Google Cloud print. Finally I did notice there is no back tray like in my old canon to print heavy cards and photos. You must use there 2 tray system. I printed a 8X10 and was told to put it in the paper tray but the gloss of the paper kept picking up the regular sheet paper and printing 2 sheets. I had to take all the paper out of the large paper tray to print the photo that came out beautiful.. There is a 2nd paper try above the first for small paper and CD\\'s. WHy it dosent accept 8 X 10 photo paper is beyond me.I haven\\'t hooked up the fax yet so no comment on that..Overall its a great printer. Just software is not up to snuff.',\n",

Both my devices and the printer is connected to the same wireless network and the printer is maybe 5ft from the wireless router but 99% of the time I try to print something, I'll get a message saying the printer is offline.  That's clearly a lie.  Every time that happens I have to re-add the printer and only sometimes windows will recognize it.  Often when I try to re-add the printer, it's never found and I just give up and ask if someone else to print my document.  The printer has horrible support for wireless printing and what's worse is that it's using an awfully ancient input port (USB-B).

Ignore the message that says you need to change your cartridge soon, as it is able to print many more pages after the message comes up.

       " 'UPDATE 6/30/16: I am not changing the stars, but I did have an improvement recently and wanted to share it with you in case you\\'re struggling with the same infuriating issue I\\'ve had with mine since the beginning: The WiFi connection.My house is teeny tiny - only 432 square feet - so how far from the printer the modem was shouldn\\'t really matter. Some people\\'s bedrooms are bigger than my whole house! However, I used to have my modem in my bedroom, and the printer in my living room. It could only find the wireless signal for the first few minutes after it would turn on, and after that it was oblivious to it. I bought this printer in LARGE part for its wireless capabilities, so I wouldn\\'t have to go to the printer every time I wanted to print something, but with this printer I had to do that and more! Every time I wanted to print something, I would have to power down the printer, wait awhile, power it up, and hope, JUST HOPE, that it would snag the signal for a moment so I could print.Recently I \"upgraded\" my wireless. I switched companies, plus went from DSL to Cable Modem. It doesn\\'t seem any better or faster to me (it was fine before; I switched companies for another reason), but speedtest.net says it\\'s a lot faster. Also, I put the modem RIGHT NEXT to the printer this time - not on purpose, but just because that\\'s the place it worked best for me to put it. I hesitate to say this, lest I jinx the improvement, and /KNOCK ON WOOD, and all that jazz, but... I haven\\'t had a single loss of wireless signal ever since. Not one. I\\'m still amazed every time I\\'m back in my bedroom and I hit \"print,\" to hear the printer start right up! It\\'s been about 2 months, now!The reason I\\'m not giving extra stars is because of my first paragraph. If the WiFi in this printer is SO crappy that it couldn\\'t even pick up my wireless signal from the next room in a tiny house (that I had no other problems with for any streaming, or otherwise, under my HEAVY internet usage), it\\'s still a pile of junk. In this day and age, there\\'s just no excuse for a crappy wireless connection.So, as I started, I just wanted to give you this tip in case you already have the printer and you\\'re going crazy because of the WiFi.-----I just hate this printer. I have given it many months so that I could get used to it, learn its eccentricities, and figure out why it behaves the way it does, but I still just hate it.I had been in the market for a GOOD printer, and had done my research. This printer fit everything I wanted, and had great reviews, so I kept my eye on it. It was around $130 at the time.I woke up the morning of Black Friday and checked my Amazon basket to see that the printer was on sale for $62, shipped. I jumped on it. I was so excited, I was actually teary-eyed- not kidding. Is that weird? :-/I told my mom about the deal, and she jumped on it too. That is a HUGE deal for my mom.The printer arrived and I set it up instantly. The set-up was really easy. The printer is beautiful. Those are the 2 pluses I will give it. (For the record, if you\\'re wondering, the red strip on the front is barely noticeable. At first, I thought they sent me the wrong one, but it is there, just much less distinct than it looks in the picture.)The first thing I tried was printing a photo from my iPhone. It kept printing sideways and on the wrong side of the sheet. EVEN when I would turn the sheet a half turn (you can make the paper sit longways or sideways) and EVEN when I would turn the sheet upside down! It\\'s like it was choosing the wrong side on purpose! Every single copy was streaked and bubbled looking, and the color was all off. I could find no way whatsoever to access print options from my phone before sending it to print, so it is what it is.Another thing I dislike intensely about this printer is that it takes FOREVER to print (the ad promises it is super fast), and it never freaking stops making racket. It is always busy in there, cleaning itself, preening like a cat.Occasionally it will start printing streaks and/or empty spots if the heads need cleaning. How on earth the heads EVER need cleaning, since it is constantly self-cleaning is beyond me. And frankly, with what little I print, there is no way I should have had an issue with this by now.Most other printers I have used will compensate with another color if one is running low, but not this one! If it has run out of one color, the printer will cease working altogether! It also runs out of ink WAY too fast. Again, I do not print that much. I have now replaced every cartridge. In the past, I usually replace cartridges about once a year. I have only had the printer since December, and I have had to replace cartridges since about 2 months in.THE WORST thing about this printer is it is constantly \"offline.\" Even when I am sitting right next to it with my computer, it is clearly on, and the wireless light is lit up, when I try to print something, it says the printer is offline. What the heck?! I will \"wake it up,\" by pressing buttons to stimulate it, but it still won\\'t print. Sometimes I can trick it into printing by printing something easy first, like a \"test\" page, and then immediately printing what I was trying to print in the first place, but sometimes that won\\'t work either. It is completely random when it is offline, and sometimes there is nothing I can do to get it to print.My mom has had all of the same issues I have had, so I know it\\'s not just me or my printer. She hates hers so much, she just boxed it up and is getting rid of it. If you knew my mom, you would know what a big deal that is.I am so disappointed in this product, and especially in Canon. They have been around long enough, and in this business long enough, that they should have put out a much better product.

I would have had to drive it two hours to Phoenix for repair if a friend hadn't have taken pity on me and fished out every piece of paper with tweezers. Also, the ink seems to go pretty fast, especially if you print photos and it's more due to the constant cleaning of the heads than the quantity of prints.

I\\'ve tried different paper quality and stock. Cleaning. Running diagnostics.  Nothing fixes the problem.  When it jams, it gives a general error message and suggests you turn the unit off and on.  If you do turn it off, it will take at least 10 minutes to warm up again.  And 2) it takes forever to start a print run.

Yes, I should have done research before purchasing and done some side by side comparisons for operating costs, but I needed a replacement and the price seemed right for the product. I could look past the ink, but the fact that when used in wi-fi mode, this printer CONSTANTLY drops connection to my computers and I have to turn the printer off and then back on to relink the device. Excuse me, I thought we were in a day in age where you could actually keep devices connected for more than 20 minutes at a time, I guess not. Lastly, the thing is enormous. It is twice the size of my computers and needs its own desk just to be setup. I was considering posting it for sale on craigs list or some other local classified pages, but I would feel bad selling this to anyone. So instead I walked up to the top story of my house and dropped it out the window. Sure, I am out $100, but at least I am not screaming streams of explatives at the thing while my blood pressure shoots through the roof.

       " 'UPDATE 63016 I am not changing the stars but I did have an improvement recently and wanted to share it with you in case youre struggling with the same infuriating issue Ive had with mine since the beginning The WiFi connectionMy house is teeny tiny  only 432 square feet  so how far from the printer the modem was shouldnt really matter Some peoples bedrooms are bigger than my whole house However I used to have my modem in my bedroom and the printer in my living room It could only find the wireless signal for the first few minutes after it would turn on and after that it was oblivious to it I bought this printer in LARGE part for its wireless capabilities so I wouldnt have to go to the printer every time I wanted to print something but with this printer I had to do that and more Every time I wanted to print something I would have to power down the printer wait awhile power it up and hope JUST HOPE that it would snag the signal for a moment so I could printRecently I upgraded my wireless I switched companies plus went from DSL to Cable Modem It doesnt seem any better or faster to me it was fine before I switched companies for another reason but speedtestnet says its a lot faster Also I put the modem RIGHT NEXT to the printer this time  not on purpose but just because thats the place it worked best for me to put it I hesitate to say this lest I jinx the improvement and KNOCK ON WOOD and all that jazz but I havent had a single loss of wireless signal ever since Not one Im still amazed every time Im back in my bedroom and I hit print to hear the printer start right up Its been about 2 months nowThe reason Im not giving extra stars is because of my first paragraph If the WiFi in this printer is SO crappy that it couldnt even pick up my wireless signal from the next room in a tiny house that I had no other problems with for any streaming or otherwise under my HEAVY internet usage its still a pile of junk In this day and age theres just no excuse for a crappy wireless connectionSo as I started I just wanted to give you this tip in case you already have the printer and youre going crazy because of the WiFiI just hate this printer I have given it many months so that I could get used to it learn its eccentricities and figure out why it behaves the way it does but I still just hate itI had been in the market for a GOOD printer and had done my research This printer fit everything I wanted and had great reviews so I kept my eye on it It was around 130 at the timeI woke up the morning of Black Friday and checked my Amazon basket to see that the printer was on sale for 62 shipped I jumped on it I was so excited I was actually tearyeyed not kidding Is that weird I told my mom about the deal and she jumped on it too That is a HUGE deal for my momThe printer arrived and I set it up instantly The setup was really easy The printer is beautiful Those are the 2 pluses I will give it For the record if youre wondering the red strip on the front is barely noticeable At first I thought they sent me the wrong one but it is there just much less distinct than it looks in the pictureThe first thing I tried was printing a photo from my iPhone It kept printing sideways and on the wrong side of the sheet EVEN when I would turn the sheet a half turn you can make the paper sit longways or sideways and EVEN when I would turn the sheet upside down Its like it was choosing the wrong side on purpose Every single copy was streaked and bubbled looking and the color was all off I could find no way whatsoever to access print options from my phone before sending it to print so it is what it isAnother thing I dislike intensely about this printer is that it takes FOREVER to print the ad promises it is super fast and it never freaking stops making racket It is always busy in there cleaning itself preening like a catOccasionally it will start printing streaks andor empty spots if the heads need cleaning How on earth the heads EVER need cleaning since it is constantly selfcleaning is beyond me And frankly with what little I print there is no way I should have had an issue with this by nowMost other printers I have used will compensate with another color if one is running low but not this one If it has run out of one color the printer will cease working altogether It also runs out of ink WAY too fast Again I do not print that much I have now replaced every cartridge In the past I usually replace cartridges about once a year I have only had the printer since December and I have had to replace cartridges since about 2 months inTHE WORST thing about this printer is it is constantly offline Even when I am sitting right next to it with my computer it is clearly on and the wireless light is lit up when I try to print something it says the printer is offline What the heck I will wake it up by pressing buttons to stimulate it but it still wont print Sometimes I can trick it into printing by printing something easy first like a test page and then immediately printing what I was trying to print in the first place but sometimes that wont work either It is completely random when it is offline and sometimes there is nothing I can do to get it to printMy mom has had all of the same issues I have had so I know its not just me or my printer She hates hers so much she just boxed it up and is getting rid of it If you knew my mom you would know what a big deal that isI am so disappointed in this product and especially in Canon They have been around long enough and in this business long enough that they should have put out a much better product I am really grateful that I bought it on a Black Friday sale and didnt pay full price for it but I am still stuck with a crappy printer that doesnt want to print and is super finicky when it does print I cant afford a new one at this time so this is it for meDont let this be it for you Find a different printer',\n",
